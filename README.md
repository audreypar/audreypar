### **Welcome to my profile!** 

I'm Audrey, a data analyst with a background in social sciences. 

I graduated a little over a year ago with my bachelors in psychology and criminology. Close to graduation, I had to face the long dreaded question of 'Ok, what's next?'. After burning the midnight oil for many nights thinking about this question, I suddenly found myself on a career path to become a data analyst. With my research and statistic skills under my belt thanks to my education I'm on a continous journey of learning analytics tools.
