### **Welcome to my profile!** 

I'm Audrey, a data analyst with a background in social sciences. 

I graduated a little over a year ago with my bachelors in psychology and criminology. Close to graduation, I had to face the long dreaded question of 'Ok, what's next?'. After burning the midnight oil for many nights thinking about this question, I suddenly found myself on a career path to become a data analyst.  

I knew this was the right decision for me because I've always valued the art of critical thinking and making informed decisions based on empricial data. I'd also wanted to build on the research, data evaluation and statistical skills I learned as an undergrad. And thus, I'm on a continous journey of learning data analysis tools and skills.
